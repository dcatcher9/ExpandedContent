                    "and vengeance, and his holy symbol is a bastard sword crossed with a crimson wing. He makes his home at the base " +
                    "of the mountain of Heaven, in his eponymous fortress, a magnificent steel structure designed to withstand a thousand-year siege " +
                    "if need be. Ragathiel takes an active role in the battle against Hell's fiendish legions. He shines at the head of his army, " +
                    "a figure of golden light cleaving through the ranks of devils that face him. Soldiers of all kinds, but particularly knights, " +
                    "pay homage to Ragathiel and pray for his virtue and wrathful strength in battle. Those who have taken vows, especially those " +
                    "of duty or vengeance, hold Ragathiel as their ideal, and his agents sometimes assist those who have been grievously wronged " +
                    "and now seek righteous vengeance. As strange as it may seem, Ragathiel is the son of Feronia, a demigoddess of the Plane of Fire, " +
                    "and Dispater, the Father of Dis. He was conceived in a brief tryst (lasting only a few centuries), after which his mother took " +
                    "him out of Hell. Ragathiel's tainted heritage has left him with a wrathful heart, and the angel struggles constantly to master " +
                    "his baser impulses in service to the light. For thousands of years he strove to prove himself to the angelic choirs of Heaven. In the " +
                    "Maelstrom he wrestled for 16 years with a monstrous evil serpent whose scales wept acidic blood until he was able to choke the " +
                    "life out of it. He led an entire army against one of the iron fortresses of Avernus and burned the castle to the ground with holy fire, " +
                    "single-handedly maiming Infernal Duke Deumus in the process. Finally the other empyreal lords agreed to admit Ragathiel into their ranks, and now " +
                    "they appear to trust the angel completely—though that trust took centuries to develop. At some point in history, Ragathiel destroyed " +
                    "Typhon, the original ruler of the first layer of Hell. He may have been manipulated into doing so by the schemes of Asmodeus to punish " +
                    "Typhon for his indiscretions. Ragathiel was once served by the Hand of the Inheritor, an angel who now acts as the goddess Iomedae's herald. " +
                    "Then known as the Hand of Vengeance, this angel asked to be reassigned to Iomedae after the death of Aroden. " +
                    "\nAppearance: Ragathiel is a tower of glorious might. He stands almost 20 feet tall, and five lofty burning wings stretch from his back. " +
                    "The General of Vengeance once had six wings, but one was severed, torn from his body by the archdevil Dispater—Ragathiel's father.   " +
                    "\nWorship: Ragathiel is commonly worshiped by the avowed, knights, soldiers, the wronged, and the empyreal lord employs aasimar, paladins, " +

                    "Followers of Ragathiel commonly wear red and silver clothing. Many also don an ornament or sigil the color of flames, typically on the helmet. " +
